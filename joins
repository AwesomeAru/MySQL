# (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
# LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
# RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
# FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
# JOIN and INNER JOIN will return the same result. INNER is the default join type for JOIN, so when you write JOIN the parser actually writes INNER JOIN.
